A simple Python script that checks whether a URL or filename looks suspicious based on common phishing keywords and risky file extensions.
This is a beginner-friendly cybersecurity project designed to help identify basic security red flags.

🔍 Features

Detects risky file extensions like .exe, .bat, .scr, .js

Flags phishing-related keywords such as free, login, verify, update

Provides quick alerts indicating potential security risks

Lightweight and easy to use — no external libraries required

🧪 How It Works

The script performs two basic checks

File Extension Check
Alerts if the filename ends with a commonly abused extension.

Phishing Keyword Check
Alerts if the URL contains common phishing-related words.

If none of these conditions are met, the script marks the input as safe based on basic rules.


code:

url = input("Enter URL or filename: ").lower()

bad_ext = [".exe", ".bat", ".scr", ".js"]
bad_words = ["free", "login", "verify", "update"]

if any(url.endswith(e) for e in bad_ext):
    print("⚠️ Suspicious file extension!")
elif any(w in url for w in bad_words):
    print("⚠️ Possible phishing pattern!")
else:
    print("✔️ Looks safe (no basic red flags).")



▶️ How to Run

Install Python (if not already installed).

Save the script as checker.py.

Run it using:python checker.py



Enter any URL or filename when prompted.
